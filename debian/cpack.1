.SH NAME
.PP
  cpack - Packaging driver provided by CMake.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
  cpack -G <generator> [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "cpack" executable is the CMake packaging program.  CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the INSTALL_* commands have packaging support.  This program will generate the package.

.PP
CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -G <generator>

CPack may support multiple native packaging systems on certain platforms. A generator is responsible for generating input files for particular system and invoking that systems. Possible generator names are specified in the Generators section.

.TP
.B -C <Configuration>
Specify the project configuration

This option specifies the configuration that the project was build with, for example 'Debug', 'Release'.

.TP
.B -D <var>=<value>
Set a CPack variable.

Set a variable that can be used by the generator.

.TP
