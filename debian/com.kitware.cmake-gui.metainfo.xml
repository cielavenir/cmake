  <description>
    CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to
    build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software
    compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
    configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that
    can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of
    CMake tools were created by Kitware in response to the need for a
    powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such
    as ITK and VTK.
